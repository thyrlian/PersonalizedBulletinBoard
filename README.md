## Backstory

A long, long time ago, when Google just launched its [Google Now](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Now), I immediately fell in love with its card design.  But the cards are far from enough.  Since then, I wanted to make an app, which is completely backed by the community, provides various kinds of feeds and views.

At the beginning, I've come up with many naming ideas, such as: FlexCards, Tiles, PremiumPersonalAssistant and etc.  But I like none of them.

## Concept

* Dynamic view distributed OTA
* Views are made by community
* Views are verified
* Views can be cached based on version, to save bandwidth
* User decides what feeds to subscribe
